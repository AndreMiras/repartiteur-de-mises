=== Updating Python GUI file ===
Update the gui.py after making gui.ui changes.
pyuic4 gui.ui -o gui.py

=== Summary ===
Single executable (Windows)

py2exe - Probably the most popular out there (PyInstaller is also gaining in popularity)
Single executable (Linux)

Freeze - works the same way like py2exe but targets Linux platform
Single executable (Mac)

py2app - again, works like py2exe but targets Mac OS


=== Linux example ===
